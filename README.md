# Tic-Tac-Toe
This repository contains a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game with a graphical user interface (GUI) using Python's `tkinter` library. The game allows two players to take turns placing their symbols ('X' and 'O') on a 3x3 grid until one of them wins or the board is full.
## Introduction
This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game with a graphical user interface (GUI) using Python's `tkinter` library. The game allows two players (Human vs CPU) to take turns placing their symbols ('X' and 'O') on a 3x3 grid until one of them wins or the board is full.

The GUI provides a user-friendly interface for playing the game, and the CPU makes random moves as the second player.

## Features
- Graphical User Interface (GUI) for an interactive gaming experience.
- Human vs CPU gameplay for single-player mode.
- Automatic detection of winning conditions and ties.
- Random CPU moves for a challenging experience.

## Getting Started
To run the Tic-Tac-Toe game, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:<br>
```bash
git clone https://github.com/JPitman26/Tic-Tac-Toe
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:<br>
```bash
cd tic-tac-toe
```

3. Run the Python script to start the game:
```bash
python tic_tac_toe.py
```

## How to Play
1. The game starts with a blank 3x3 grid.
2. The player (symbol 'X') goes first and clicks on an empty cell to place their symbol.
3. The CPU (symbol 'O') makes its move automatically after the player's move.
4. Continue taking turns until one player wins or the board is full.
5. If there's a winner, a message will appear to declare the winner.
6. If the board is full with no winner, the game ends in a tie.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- tkinter library (usually included with Python installations)
  
## Potential Features
- Larger boards 4x4, 5x5, 6x6
- Player vs Player
- Player vs Player vs CPU on larger boards
