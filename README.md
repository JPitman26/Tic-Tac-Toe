# Tic-Tac-Toe
This repository contains a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game with a graphical user interface (GUI) using Python's `tkinter` library. The game allows two players to take turns placing their symbols ('X' and 'O') on a 3x3 grid until one of them wins or the board is full.
